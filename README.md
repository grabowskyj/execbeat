# execbeat
Execbeat for Elasticsearch
I modified a bit the Execbeat for my purposes, thus it also able to:
  - measure the duration of an executed command
  - timeout can be set for a command in the .yml file with key timeout
I just commited the modified files which should be placed to the execbeat/beater directory if you want to use the functionality.
